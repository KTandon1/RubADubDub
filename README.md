Effective hand washing is one of the most important -- and easiest -- ways to
prevent the spread of diseases. According to the Center for Disease Control
(CDC), nearly 2.2 million children die each year due to diarrheal diseases and
respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia.  Proper hand washing with soap could
protect 1/3 of such children from diarrhea and 1/6 of children from pneumonia
[1].  In health care and food preparation environments, effective hand washing
is widely accepted to be requisite for public safety. Despite the health
benefits, a Michigan State study found that only 5% of people follow proper
hand washing techniques [2].

Our goal is to build a system that monitors a person's hand washing and offers
suggestions such that proper hand washing protocols are followed. 
There are 5 steps for proper hand washing:  

1.  Wet your hands with running water (comfortable temperature is suggested
[3], not too hot)
2.  Lather your hands with soap
3.  Scrub your hands for 20 seconds
4.  Rinse your hands with running water
5.  Dry your hands
