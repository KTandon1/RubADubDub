TestSeek
========

Test application to interface with the Seek Thermal imaging camera (android version)

This is still pretty basic, I'll improve it as I have time.

It should be straightforward to compile with VS2013 Express (should work on other versions too)


You will need an appropriate adapter cable to attach the sensor to a PC

Then use Zadig to install the winusb driver on the "iAP Interface" device that enumerates when you plug it in

After this, the app should automatically connect to the camera when you launch it.
